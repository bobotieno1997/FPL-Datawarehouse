 =============================================================
 Gold Layer Table Creation
 =============================================================
 Script Purpose:
 This script creates the dimension and fact table structures in the 'gold' layer of the 
 Fantasy Premier League (FPL) data warehouse. This layer is designed for clean, 
 structured, and query-optimized data used for reporting and analytics.
 
 The schema includes:
 - Dimensional tables for teams, players, and stat types
 - Fact tables for player history, team standings, match results, player stats, and upcoming games
 
 Assumptions:
 - The database already exists and is accessible
 - The 'gold' schema is being used or referenced implicitly
 - Keys are managed and either populated by source systems or automatically incremented
 
 Conventions:
 - Primary keys are defined on all tables to support analytics engine indexing
 - Data types are optimized for performance and consistency
 - Naming follows Dim (dimension) and Fct (fact) conventions for clarity
 
 WARNING:
 - These statements use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so re-running them wonâ€™t overwrite existing tables
 - To recreate or alter table structures, you will need to drop them explicitly
 - Ensure foreign keys are respected in downstream models if added later
